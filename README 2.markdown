# MediShop Uganda

## Project Purpose
MediShop Uganda is an online store for medical equipment and supplies, designed to provide healthcare professionals and individuals in Uganda with high-quality products. Modeled after Jumia Uganda, the website features a responsive, interactive multi-page design with a medical theme.

## Structure
- **index.html**: Home page with a hero section and featured products.
- **products.html**: Displays all medical equipment with filters and search functionality.
- **product-details.html**: Shows detailed information for a selected product.
- **about.html**: Information about MediShop Uganda.
- **contact.html**: Contact form with validation.
- **faq.html**: Frequently asked questions.
- **gallery.html**: Visual gallery of all products.
- **css/styles.css**: Styles for responsive design and medical theme (blues, whites, greens).
- **js/scripts.js**: JavaScript for interactivity (menu toggle, search, filters, cart, form validation).
- **images/**: Placeholder images referenced via Unsplash URLs.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with a toggle menu for small screens.
- **Interactivity**: Search bar, category filters, cart system, and form validation.
- **Medical Equipment**: 20 items across categories (Diagnostic, Surgical, Monitoring, Therapeutic, Mobility, Furniture) with placeholder images.
- **Navigation**: Consistent header and footer across all pages.

## Deployment
The website is deployed on GitHub Pages. To deploy:
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Push the project files to the repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
4. Access the live site at `https://<clovis-cleopas>.github.io/<plp-webtechnologies-classroom-july2025-july-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Final-Project-and-Depl>`.

## Live URL
(Replace with actual URL after deployment)

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Ensure all files are in the correct folder structure (`css/`, `js/`, `images/`).

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic structure.
- CSS: Responsive styling with a medical theme.
- JavaScript: Interactivity and dynamic content.
- GitHub Pages: Hosting.

## Notes
- Placeholder images are used from Unsplash due to the inability to include local images.
- The cart system is basic and stores data in memory (resets on page refresh).
- The contact form uses client-side validation and displays alerts (no backend integration).
